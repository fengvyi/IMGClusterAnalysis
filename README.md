Cross Laboratory of Shandong University

1.Identified and researched Fast Search algorithm in “Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks.” 
(Rodriguez, A., & Laio, A. (2014). Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks. Science, 344(6191), 1492-1496. http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6191/1492)

2.Developed a program in C++ using OpenCV, applying the Fast Search algorithm, which recognized clusters and could segment images in a given JPG image

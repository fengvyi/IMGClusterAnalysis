# Clustering Algorithm and Superpixel Segmentation, SDU                                                         
## Cross Laboratory of Shandong University

* Identified and researched Fast Search algorithm of “Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks.” 
 (Rodriguez, A., & Laio, A. (2014). [Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks]( http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6191/1492). Science, 344(6191), 1492-1496.)

* Developed a program in C++ using OpenCV, applying the Fast Search algorithm, which recognized clusters and could segment images in a given JPG image
